Botcatmaxy is a discord bot focused on helping moderate discord servers. People who have used MEE6 will notice a similarity with the basic commands but Botcatmaxy has many changes on top of the basic "moderation bot" that you can see over in the wiki. It has a robust autofilter that does a lot of work to balance false flags with catching things that other bots wouldn't. Of course we also provide tons of customization in this aspect if you really would like to avoid false warnings.

If you're interested [click here to add the bot to your Discord server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=488796531512573953&permissions=403008582&scope=bot)! 

We also have very quick support and discussion over on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/hgxynGZ). We are always looking for feedback and ways to improve, even when it's just focusing on one feature over another or as massive as a feature just not doing its job. There's a lot of bots out there, and what's best can differ from server to server, so we always value your input.
